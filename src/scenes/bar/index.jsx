Notably, Uttar Pradesh emerges as the highest consumer of water, utilizing 2,200 million cubic meters (MCM) due to its large population and extensive agricultural activities. Rajasthan and Punjab follow closely with 1,900 MCM and 1,800 MCM, respectively, reflecting their water-intensive agricultural practices. States like Gujarat and Maharashtra also exhibit significant water usage, highlighting the demand in industrial sectors. On the other hand, smaller states such as Sikkim, Mizoram, and Nagaland show comparatively lower water consumption, underlining the varying demand based on population size and land use. This chart underscores the critical need for efficient water management policies to address the disparities in water usage and ensure sustainable practices across the country.</p>
